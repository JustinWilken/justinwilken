			<p>My kitchen of the future is an extension of our adventurous past. Cozy smells of home-made recipes. The idea of home-made takes on (or back) another meaning: cultivating our surrounding biological worlds, augmenting the nature in which energy flows, fine tuning recipes into a science of mixology into which its segmented parts (proportions and components) are better defined by the language of our primal senses than notions of a food item existing in its form of completeness, unaltered by evolutionary revision.</p>
			<p>See <a href="https://gfi.org/" title="Alt Protein Science">The Good Food Institute</a> and <a href="https://new-harvest.org/" title="Cellular Agriculture Science">New Harvest</a> for further tangible industry, scientific, community, and investment resources!</p>

			<h3>Functionality</h3>
			<p>The physical homey design is reminiscent of the past, imagine it to be your own: the function of the kitchen hasn't changed much. What is novel are modified techniques of creation: storing, mixing, heating, pressure, cooling, drying, disposal. </p>
			<p>How we decide the subject of, and for, our creation is the point in which our feelings and emotions start to present themselves. Experimentation begins.</p>

			<h3>The Lived Experience</h3>
			<p>I rise before the brink of dawn to collect the essence of the previous night before the inklings of sun rise. I wear socks that capture the soil, unscented lotion that captures the aroma brought by the wind, and an apron with deep pockets to bring in the best produce in the vicinity. The seemingly empty space is filled with the discerning attention and intention of the observer (as is this website).</p>
			<p>Scents/spices (an array of atoms captured on a fatty base) and organic matter (in the form of cells/microbes) supplement my traditional plants and life forms within my generous garden.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="participation" id="zen-participation" role="article">
			<h3>Fostering Life and Sensual Actualizations</h3>
			<p>As I walk back to my kitchen, the rising sun is absorbed into my body and kitchen, starting the processes necessary for ingestion and digestion. Solar panels, chirping birds, opening oxygen valves, and spouting water vapor seem to bring my kitchen to life.</p>
			<p>The aroma I carried is inserted into my budding bioreactor, comforted and nourished with what it needs to feel at home, and converted through the process of <a href="https://gfi.org/science/the-science-of-fermentation/">precision fermentation</a> into my drink of the day (and the night for that matter)! The ambience and smells of the kitchen deeply mirrors the outside environment, and sets the tone and direction for the day’s efforts. </p>
			<p>The soil on my socks is added to the kitchen’s houseplants: the world of microorganisms within these houseplants is routinely borrowed from and utilized through the budding biomass reactor, in which they grow them into functional proteins for my consumption. The plant and fungal life I brought in from the garden are then used as the primary base for the food I eat, once in a while modified or supplemented by the various cultured oils and residues from my daily aromatic and microorganism scavenge.</p>

			<h3>Accomodation on a Cellular Level</h3>
			<p>When a visitor wishes to consume an animal life form, I urge them to bring a cellular-sample (biopsy) from one they have crossed paths with along the way. I offer the use of one of our favorite bioreactor and scaffolding appliances: the cell cultivator, a novel form of <a href="https://new-harvest.org/what-is-cellular-agriculture/">cellular agriculture harvest</a> that allows a more efficient, ethical, and edible form of energy transfer.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="requirements" id="zen-requirements" role="article">
			<h3>Intertwined</h3>
			<p>Our wide variety of fermented foods within our fridge allows for a rowdy and diverse spectacle within our guts and dining room. There is never a day our taste buds and differing values are not accounted for: the kitchen welcomes both minimalism and maximalism.</p>
			<p>The knowledge and experiences of our immediate ecosystem is utilized within the kitchen's cuisine through my morning routine selection process. Bioreactor and scaffolding processes create and form. What is unwanted goes to where it is needed (the bountiful backyard)!</p>
			<p role="contentinfo">By <a href="linkedin.com/in/justin-wilken-5925ba217">Justin Wilken</a>, a dude who is attempting for himself to better define the possibilities of a home that are applicable towards developing a fulfilling vocational and personal roadmap of life. To him, the intention behind the home design process symbolizes personal commitment.</p>
			<p>  Perhaps, disruptive technological advancements, like food innovation, will incentivize individuals to creatively intertwine futurisms in an interdisciplinary fashion in order to cultivate a more engaging, empathetic, valuable, and impactful worldview.</p>
