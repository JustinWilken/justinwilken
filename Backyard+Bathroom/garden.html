			<h3>The Road to Enlightenment</h3>
			<p>“Composers make pieces of music. These were decomposers, who unmake pieces of life.”</p>
			<p>“Some organisms—like most animals—find food in the world and put it inside their bodies, where it is digested and absorbed. Fungi have a different strategy. They digest the world where it is and then absorb it into their bodies.”</p>
			<p>“Biology—the study of living organisms—had transformed into ecology—the study of the relationships between living organisms.”</p>

			<h3>So What is This About?</h3>
			<p>Bathrooms. Usually there is an intention to come and go, perhaps with a sense of urgency. They tend to not be the destination in of itself. For the sake of that function, I will navigate the path to which waste disposal leads.</p>
			<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/bioremediation" title="Bioremediation">Bioremediation</a> is the use of either naturally occurring or deliberately introduced microorganisms or other forms of life to consume and break down environmental pollutants. Toilets exist for our consumed waste, and pharmaceuticals or cosmetics help remedy perceived bodily formations that are undesired. The tools within an ideal bathroom are key to both the internal fluidity and outward presentation of our bodily processes, so I think the name bioremediation bathroom to be quite fitting.

			<h3>Participation</h3>
			<p>Gleaming droplets derived from solar-powered hydropanels rest on reflective mirrors and display the muted blues of the interior and vibrant greens of the windowed-exterior: the wooden balcony exterior of the bathroom draped by a magnificent canopy of woody sycamores, supported below by agave, hibiscus, and lavender plants. These scents are encapsulated in cosmetics that are made from natural sources on the outskirts of the property. If need be functional acellular materials that are used to smooth or bind-<a href="https://thespoon.tech/geltor-debuts-animal-free-collagen-for-food-and-beverage-markets/" title="Geltor">collagens</a>, glycerides, caseins-can be derived from the cultivated kitchen bioreactors. </p>
			<p>My bathroom’s sewage would lead to the compost of my generous garden. My sewage system, like Mush’s Biofabrication Room, would be constructed from mycelium fabrication. Along the way, any of the toxic contaminants that might enter would be <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4920763/" title="Fungi Metabolization">metabolized</a> by fungi, who would build their own highly efficient and elaborate route to direct the usable waste products of such processes towards the garden, bountiful backyard, and any connected ecosystem.
</p>
			<p>Bountiful generosity. Such is a trait I strive for. Once we realize that there is plenty to give and that we are not as tightly bound as we portray, we can flourish and compassionately consume what is given in turn.</p>

		<div class="benefits" id="zen-benefits" role="article">
			<h3>Benefits</h3>
			<p>If there is anything I’ve learned from diligently and enthusiastically watching my parents craft the backyard of the house I was born and raised in, I understand that my future backyard and garden, like my home, will shift in aesthetic, taste, and functionality in response to different stimuli.
</p>
		</div>

		<div class="requirements" id="zen-requirements" role="article">
			<h3>Requirements</h3>
			<p>My garden need not be expansive. Once we realize that the method in which we grow and distribute is they key, biodiversity and the balance it brings will continue to reward those who promote it. I wish to remove any barriers from my lived experiences, hence why the fruits of my labor will transfer directly to the next trophic level (from what was before the sun, to sun, to primary producer, to us), and then composed into another useful flowing formation.</p>
			<p>The compost will be a hot mass of energy that feeds into the heating system of my home. Biosensors will allow others (like the human me) to better understand the fertility and health of the plants, whereas I will allow those who are best at what they do to harvest (robotics/automation for labor/transport, pigs/dogs for truffle hunting, etc.).</p>
			<p> I will use the most resilient and nourishing crops available to me: genetic modification is acceptable as long as the surrounding biome is well adapted for its nutrient intake. Fungal, herbal, and pesticides are not necessary to sustain the longevity of the land.
</p>
			<p>The entire ecosystem is my playground, so the backyard will be a communal one. The plants hopefully filled with birds, bees, and trees of all kinds (to remind me of my old home), and ponds teeming with aquatic life!
