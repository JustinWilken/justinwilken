			<h3> <abbr title="Purpose and Objectives">My Mission</abbr></h3>
			<p>I live to ispire creative optimism and fulfillment. I envision a resilient living world that embodies the intrinsic values of collaboration, innovation, stewardship, and gratitude for the aesthetic.</p>
			<p>Living to influence and engage myself and others in this lifestyle and worldview is an ambitious goal I have set for myself, yet one that is equally obtainable. Perhaps fulfillment supersedes measuring impact. </p>
			<p>I have created this <abbr title="Acting as the schemas I return to">home</abbr>page to <abbr title="Referring to containing functionality and cohesion">house</abbr> my framework for achieving this potential I envision we have the capability to encompass together.</p>

			<h3>Theories of Change</h3>
			<p>Powerful mental instruments guide complex, large-scale efforts that seek ambitious goals. A multiplicity of perspective, experience, and information create space for processes to become more inclusive and accurate towards predicting the pathway of change. Intangible systems govern our psyche.</p>
			<p>Examining the underlying assumption of my beliefs has rejuvinated my eagerness to expand the bounds of my curiosity. Reflecting on the outcomes of my unique context within this unsettling expanse of uncertainty is intrinsic to my evaluation of a well lived, abundant, and conscious social and professional legacy.</p>

		<div class="participation" id="zen-participation" role="article">
			<h3>Relationships</h3>
			<p>What is the essence of the value I wish to provide? Communicating a meaningful response requires us to be historians of our subjective pasts. Often, the web of relations we hold dear to us function as a living embodiment of documentation. Any setting or element we allocate our attention to becomes the medium by which our commitments to identity take shape. Nevertheless, we trace our steps.</p>
			<p>In my life, I remember moments like, as a tolder, spitting out my juice to share the last drops with my brother. On family hikes I'm told I was a shepard as a young boy, attentively making sure no one strayed too far from the pack. Throughout my schooling, I was hesitant to settle on a singular discipline or activity, and gleefully challenged my limits in a playful yet competitive manner. Upon visiting Sequoia National Park for the first time, my constant state of wonderment was expressed by a wholesome question I asked my parents: Who planted all these trees?</p>

		<div class="benefits" id="zen-benefits" role="article">
			<h3>Immerse</h3>
			<p>Attatchment is one's own extension. Prolongation and expansion are communal yearnings, thereby incentivizing intimacy, awareness, bonding, fusion, mentorship, and an earnest infatuation for our sensory experience of the world. This is the pinnacle I strive for. </p>
		</div>

		<div class="requirements" id="zen-requirements" role="article">
			<h3>Finding My Niche</h3>
			<p>Plotting a line of best fit in the scatterplot of my life is ongoing as I prioritize and forget. Countless philosophies compete for the claim of accuracy and understanding regarding connecting the dots. Permeating concepts, assumptions, and pressures create spatial, temporal, and cognitive direction.  </p>
			<p>Even so, I think I know things about myself. I cherish the fleeting glimpse of refraction: interminglings, or lack thereof, of light, water, movement, emulsion, silence, affection, reverberation, kinship, lightness, desire, sorrow, patience, language, solution, narrative, innocence, guilt, breathe, loved-ones, shimmer, song, and energy. I plan to revisit these words. Perhaps pluck some out, or add as many as I can until I feel the function of this medium is no longer met. Can home be infinite?</p>
			<p>I've made an impossible list and have checked something off of it. In my pursuit of a balance between practicality and idealism, unnassuming yet unique moments in my life have opened my eyes to boundless possibilities. I hope the path I stray to somehow, somewhere connects to yours. The space below is reserved for the words I collect from you along the way. UNDER RENNOVATION</p>
